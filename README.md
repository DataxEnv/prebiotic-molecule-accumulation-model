# Prebiotic Molecule Accumulation Simulation
This project presents a computational model investigating the accumulation dynamics of prebiotic organic molecules in open surface environments, such as shallow ponds, on the early Earth. The system focuses on **system-level behavior**, rather than specific chemical reactions, capturing:
* Molecular production,
* Degradation and loss processes,
* Periodic environmental input.

The dynamics are formalized as an **ordinary differential equation** and solved numerically. Sensitivity analyses are performed to assess outcomes under varying environmental parameters.

All assumptions, governing equations, technical details, and interpretations are fully documented **within the Jupyter Notebook**.


## About the Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook in this repository is intentionally written to be **self-contained**, and accessible **step-by-step.**
It guides through:

* Model assumptions,
* Parameter definitions,
* Numerical integration,
* Basic sensitivity analyses,
* Visualization of results.
  
To avoid redundancy, all technical explanations are kept within the notebook.

## Tools Used
* Python
* NumPy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

##  Note
This repository represents my **first serious attempt at computational modeling**. The model is intentionally simple, transparent, and reflective. The emphasis is on understanding the modeling process, interpreting results physically and acknowledging limitations.
